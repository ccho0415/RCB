			<h1>The Diaries of a New Boomkin Player</h1>
			<p class="lead">Day 1:</p>
			<p>Dear Diary,</p>
			<p>I thought I wanted to start playing as a Restoration Druid. They are just like my holy priest after all. However, one day I was messing around with all the druid specs. and I found you, the boomkin spec, I realized I was wrong. There is nothing in the world that is better than running around as an owl bear putting dots on people and shooting moons, stars, and sun matter at them. It was the most fun I've ever had in my WoW life. I have seen the light, and now I will never go back.</p>
			<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p>Dear Diary,</p>
			<p>After the long grueling grind to level 100, I finally reached to the promised land, the Dreamgrove. It was just as I imagined it to be. It is so lush, green, full of life, clean, and full of animals too. It makes me feel as if I am attuned with nature. I also realized that I had so many places to explore within the dreamgrove.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>My own little house with a cute bed</li>
				<li>The Circle of Spirits</li>
				<li>Tel'andu Burrow</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope to come back with more stories,</p>
			<p>Tomoneko</p>

			<p class="lead">Day 3:</p>
			<p>Dear Diary,</p>
			<p>As I was traveling through the Broken Islands of Azeroth, I realized that I needed some sick beats to listen to. I thought you should listen to them too.</p>

			<p class="lead">Day 4:</p>
			<p>Dear Diary,</p>
			<p>The other day I was dungeoning around Azeroth and I realized. I'm OOM. Oh god no, the worst fate to ever happen to a boomkin. What do I do??? Do I just call it quits now? Do I give up my life as a boomkin? But then a light shone on me. It was Elune. She descended and said ,"Don't worry child. Your mana will come back soon." And just like that. BAM I had my mana back. I will never be an <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oomkin">oomkin</a> again.</p>
			<p>Back with Confidence,</p>
