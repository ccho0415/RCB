# Static positioning

## We use margin and padding to statically position elements. These are explained using the box model.

* Consider the following analogy:

  * Imagine your car is an HTML element.

  * You are the content inside the element.

  * Your car's interior space is the padding.

  * The border is the surface of the car.

  * Margin is the space you put between your car and every other vehicle.

* Statically positioned elements can't cross each other. Even if you give them a fixed with.

* By default, every HTML element is statically positioned.

* Static elements behave similar to the way text flows in a Word document. Top to bottom, left to right. This is the normal "flow" of the page.
